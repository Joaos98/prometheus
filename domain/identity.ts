/**
 * Where every identity in a Household comes from: a member's, a row's, and the fresh one
 * Repurposing mints. Nothing about an identity matters except that no two are ever the
 * same, so this is a UUID and the whole of what this module is for.
 *
 * `crypto.randomUUID` is the right answer and is used wherever it exists — but browsers
 * withhold it outside a secure context, which is precisely where Prometheus is expected
 * to run: a self-hosted deployment reached at `http://192.168.1.10:8080`, and a demo
 * published somewhere without a certificate. Left to reach for it directly, the app
 * throws on the first row anybody records, or before the demo's sample Household has
 * rendered at all.
 *
 * `crypto.getRandomValues` is not gated that way, so the fallback is the same 122 random
 * bits laid out as a version 4 UUID by hand. It is the same identity by every measure
 * that matters here; the only difference is which function drew the bytes.
